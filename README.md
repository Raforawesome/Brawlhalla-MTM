# Brawlhalla Map Theme Manager
### A small program to manage Brawlhalla map themes, made in Rust.
This program fetches maps and a manifest from https://raforaweso.me/brawlhalla-maps

This program is a Rust rewrite of a similar working program in Go, also found on my GitHub profile.

**This project is currently a WIP and does not work yet.**
