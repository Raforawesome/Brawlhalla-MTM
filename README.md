# Brawlhalla Map Theme Manager
### A small program to manage Brawlhalla map themes, made in Rust.
This program fetches maps and a manifest from https://raforaweso.me/brawlhalla-maps

This program is a Rust rewrite of a similar working program in Go, also found on my GitHub profile.

Known issues:
default (reset) map theme doesn't work, this is due to an error in the zip file itself.  Will fix soon.
